Ludum Dare 45
=============

Theme: Start with nothing

Immediate Ideas
---------------

Map is blank - nothing
Explore the map to get something

Player has nothing
Play the game to get something

Start with nothing - end with nothing?
You come into the world with nothing, you leave the world with nothing
Collect things to get through the level, but make sure you can leave them behind

Puzzle game
Spatial puzzle where you move blocks of things

Platformer where you collect items needed to go through a level


Adventure game
Simple adventure game
Quests?
Level traversal and fight?
Trade up game? Start with nothing and trade it for something. Trade until you have something big

Create everything from nothing

Some type of building puzzle with cubes

Start with a cube.
Can place cubes on your cube.
Build to a specification to accomplish a thing

Manage goldfish
Start with an empty tank
fill it with fish and things to make fish happy
Watch out for the carnivorious fish though

Space
Nothing is in space
Make planets in space
Make a solar system in space
Add planets into a solar system without causing gravitational problems and becoming a black hole?
Gravity physics could be hard
And how do you throw interest into it?
Predetermined planets
Interdependencies?
Jellyfish?


Vindictive NPCs?
Player starts with nothing
Can't even move
Has no abilities
NPCs all making fun of him
Accidentally give him something
Gets the rest by using it

But what are the mechanics
I can think of 2D game where you are shapes
Like Thomas was Alone,
but not really what I want to make

Adventure style seems too intense
Dialogue while walking is an entire system by itself


Maybe the game is about going around and talking to people
You can't say anything to begin with because you start with nothing
No knowledge of the language
No knowledge of how to speak
Nothing?
You simply observe conversation and then find key words or phrases from the
conversation.
You can then use them to unlock more conversation until you can complete the game

Problem is, this is script heavy and requires a store to tell that is interesting
I don't have any of those laying around at the moment

How do you get something out of nothing?
Or how do you leave with nothing like you came in with nothing?

What mechanic requires you get something in order to progress?

Potentially Good Ideas
----------------------

Racing game with no track
You have to create the track?
Tron-like?

Start a race
There is no track
First player defines the track
Each time they cross over the track, a boost is created
The track must reach a certain length before it can be reconnected
Two laps must be completed to win


Platformer where there are no platforms

You summon platforms into space
Like tetris you can only summon a predetermined type of platform
It must connect to your platform


Gates with keys?
Weapons for enemies?
Dungeon crawler?
You start with no weapons
And no armor
>	"and as everyone comes, so they depart.
>	They take nothing from their toil
>	that they can carry in their hands."
Ecc 5:15
Can only pick things up from chests
Can only put things down in chests
Monsters respawn when you exit rooms
Doors reclose when you exit rooms
Maybe on a timer?
Maybe after a certain number of events
