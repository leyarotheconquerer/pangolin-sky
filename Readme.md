Theme: Start with nothing

Concept

Platformer where there are no platforms
You begin with no platforms

* You spawn on a platform in space
* You must reach a platform in space
* You can pick up a platform type to place
* You can attach platfrom types you've picked up to existing platforms on pre-determined sides
* You can jump
* You can run
* You can grapple?
* Maybe buttons
* Maybe bridges
* When placing platforms, you can zoom out and get a full view of the level
* Then you zoom in to a third person view?
